# UI Package Audit Notice

Date: 2026-09-09

## Scope

This notice records the reference audit for `packages/ui`.
The audit covered the package source, data, style files, and shared components.

Do not remove a public component only because an application does not use it today.
The `./components/*` package export makes each component part of the public package contract.

## Gallery boundary

The UIUX Gallery belongs to `devkits/uiux/web/src/modules/gallery`. It consumes package components
through public `@codexsun/ui` exports. Do not add gallery source to this package.
Other applications must not import UIUX or depend on `@codexsun/uiux-web`.

## Gallery-only public components

These components have no application or shared runtime references.
The current UI gallery uses them as live documentation specimens:

- Accordion
- Aspect Ratio
- Attachment
- Bubble
- Button Group
- Calendar
- Carousel
- Context Menu
- Direction
- Empty
- Hover Card
- Input OTP
- Item
- Marker
- Menubar
- Message
- Message Scroller
- Native Select
- Navigation Menu
- Pagination
- Progress
- Questionnaire
- Radio Group
- Resizable
- Slider
- Sonner
- Toast

These components are not unreachable. Their public exports make removal a package contract change.
Deprecate a component before removal if applications or add-ons can consume the package externally.

## Internally required components

These components have no direct application import, but shared UI code requires them:

- Avatar
- Breadcrumb
- Chart
- Checkbox
- Combobox
- Command
- Drawer
- Field
- Input Group
- Kbd
- Popover
- Skeleton
- Spinner
- Table
- Toggle
- Toggle Group

Do not remove these components while their blocks, layouts, templates, or child components use them.

## Public modules without a direct application import

These package exports do not have a direct application consumer:

- `blocks/form`
- `blocks/workspace`
- `templates/dashboard-01`
- `templates/documentation-sidebar`
- `templates/sidebar-07`

The live UI documentation uses the Form block. Review the other exports before deprecation or removal.

## Audit result

- Directly used by applications: 19 components
- Used by shared UI code: 16 components
- Used only by the UI gallery: 27 components
- Completely unreferenced component files: 0
- Package-owned gallery composition files: 0
- Obvious temporary, backup, or copied files: 0

## Cleanup boundary

1. Keep gallery code in `devkits/uiux`; keep reusable UI implementation in `packages/ui`.
2. Run the UI typecheck, lint, build, and package boundary checks.
3. Review public usage before removing a component or package export.
4. Add a deprecation record for every intentional public contract removal.
